Created a multiple choice quiz using Functions, Arrays, a for loop, objects, HTML and CSS. The Quiz is setup with 4 options per question. With a footer in the HTML that tracks your progress. There are 5 questions and it shows your score at the end of the quiz. I have done more research on this one assignment and I still feel like it could be better. I do not have time to to add a timer at this time but I will come back to it and add later.

resources I used:

google
w3Schools
tutor
TA's
My peers
youtube

Please go easy I really struggled with this.
